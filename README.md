# FAMD Analysis on Environmental and Lifestyle Cancer Risk Factors
## Overview
This repository contains the R code used for the Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) as part of our research on the impact of environmental and lifestyle factors on cancer risk. Our study focuses on the role of extracellular vesicle oncomiRs in cancer development, analyzing how these microRNAs respond to various environmental and lifestyle influences.

# Study Summary
The study investigated plasma levels of EV-borne oncomiRs in a population with a body mass index > 25 kg/m^2, aiming to understand the regulatory networks of miRNAs in response to exogenous influences. By leveraging the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) model, we explored interactions between environmental/lifestyle exposures and EV oncomiRs, uncovering non-linear relationships among variables.

# FAMD Analysis Contribution
FAMD was employed to investigate multivariate relationships among miRNA expressions and exposure variables, serving as a critical tool for understanding the complex interplay between these factors. This analysis facilitated the identification of significant predictors and their non-linear/non-additive effects on miRNA expression, contributing significantly to our comprehension of miRNA regulation in the context of cancer risk factors.
